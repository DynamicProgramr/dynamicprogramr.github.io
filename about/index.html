    My passion is developing custom application for mobile devices and the Web.  I like to give my clients the software application that is going to solve THEIR problems and make their business run more smoothly.

    I am a result-oriented, versatile, skilled and dedicated professional software developer. I am a self-starter who is very organized and a great problem solver - things I feel are necessary to make a successful developer.

    I have over 15 years experience in the computer industry and software development.  I started out as a computer tech.  In my work with CitiCorp Mortgage, I was always eager to learn the 'network administrator' job functions.  The motivated me to become a Certified Administrator.  But, that wasn't enough.  As a systems administrator, I felt that custom programming could make routine tasks easier (and automatic).  So, I pushed more and learned to develop in several languages, including Visual Basic, C++, and Java. This was back in the early days of the Web. As the Web grew, I realized it was going to be a great place for communications.  I setup my own website and began to really dig into the technologies available.  Since then I have advanced my knowledge and career in the field of Web and mobile technologies.

    These days my projects are almost exclusively Web and mobile applications.  I am a full-stack, cross-platform developer. I believe in communicating with my clients on a regular basis. Constant communication is the best way to make sure I am developing what the client wants and needs!

    My skills include: PHP (15+ years), HTML/XHTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, AngularJS, Bootstrap, and WebRTC.

    And I love what I do!
